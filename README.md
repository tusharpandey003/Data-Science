# Basics of Data-SCience


DS-1 --- Data Analysis/visualisation with help of numpy,pandas,Matplotlib.

The repository you’re referring to is a comprehensive resource for data science, with a specific focus on data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. 
The repository includes a folder named “Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy”, which contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to basic data visualization.

This notebook demonstrates how to use NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib’s Pyplot for data visualization.
NumPy is used for numerical computing and supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

The notebook uses Matplotlib’s Pyplot, a collection of functions that provide a MATLAB-like interface for making plots and charts.
It demonstrates how to create various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. It also shows how to customize these plots by adding labels, titles, legends, and adjusting the color and size of the plot elements.

DS-2--- Exploratory Data Analysis for Time Series Machine Learning Data

This notebook is dedicated to the meticulous process of preparing time series data for machine learning applications. Our journey begins with the loading of time series data and corresponding labels, followed by their concatenation into a unified database.

The data preparation phase involves several crucial steps:

Removing Redundant Columns: We streamline the dataset by eliminating unnecessary features that do not contribute to the model’s performance.
Duplicate Removal: Ensuring the uniqueness of each data point, we remove any duplicate entries.
Handling Missing Values: We employ strategies to address gaps in the dataset, either by imputation or exclusion, to maintain data integrity.
Data Type Conversion: Each feature is cast into its appropriate data type to facilitate subsequent analysis.
With the data primed, we delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA):

Anomaly and Outlier Detection: Utilizing graphical tools, we identify and rectify anomalies and outliers that could skew our model’s learning.
Autocorrelation and Stationarity Checks: Essential for time series forecasting, we assess the data’s autocorrelation and stationarity, applying transformations if necessary.
Finally, we focus on preprocessing and feature dimensionality reduction:

Preprocessing: Standardizing and normalizing the features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA are applied to distill the essence of the data, enhancing the model’s ability to learn from the most significant features.
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for transforming raw time series data into a refined form, ready for the development of robust machine learning models.
