# Basics of Data-SCience


DS-1 --- Data Analysis/visualisation with help of numpy,pandas,Matplotlib.

The repository you’re referring to is a comprehensive resource for data science, with a specific focus on data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. 
The repository includes a folder named “Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy”, which contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to basic data visualization.

This notebook demonstrates how to use NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib’s Pyplot for data visualization.
NumPy is used for numerical computing and supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

The notebook uses Matplotlib’s Pyplot, a collection of functions that provide a MATLAB-like interface for making plots and charts.
It demonstrates how to create various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. It also shows how to customize these plots by adding labels, titles, legends, and adjusting the color and size of the plot elements.
